# zylentrix

This Flutter application demonstrates API integration by fetching and displaying data from a public API. The app makes an HTTP request to the 
JSONPlaceholder API to retrieve a list of posts and displays them in a scrollable ListView.

It showcases key Flutter development concepts, including:
- HTTP request handling** using the `http` package
- Asynchronous programming** using `FutureBuilder`
- Displaying a loading indicator** while fetching data
- Graceful error handling
